# Subscriber Count Management Approach: Observer Pattern

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to outline the design decision to utilize the observer pattern for tracking the number of subscribers to the YouTube channel in our system. The observer pattern provides an elegant solution for automatically updating the subscriber count whenever subscribers are added or removed.

## Problem Statement

We need a mechanism to accurately track the number of subscribers to the YouTube channel. This count is vital for various analytics and reporting purposes. Additionally, we want to ensure that the subscriber count is always up-to-date without manually managing it.

## Solution: Observer Pattern

After careful consideration of various options, we have decided to rely on the observer pattern to handle subscriber count management. The observer pattern establishes a relationship between the `YouTubeChannel` class and its observers, allowing us to automatically update the count whenever subscribers are added or removed.

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Subscriber Count**: By leveraging the observer pattern, the subscriber count is dynamically determined based on the number of registered observers. This ensures that the count is always accurate and up-to-date without requiring manual intervention.

2. **Simplified Code**: The observer pattern simplifies the management of the subscriber count by automatically handling the registration and notification of observers. This reduces the complexity of our codebase and eliminates the need for explicit count maintenance.

3. **Flexible and Extensible**: The observer pattern provides a flexible and extensible solution. It allows for easy addition of new observers without impacting the core logic of the `YouTubeChannel` class. This makes it convenient to incorporate future enhancements or changes to the subscriber management system.

## Trade-offs

1. **Tighter Coupling**: Relying on the observer pattern introduces a level of coupling between the `YouTubeChannel` class and its observers. The class depends on the `Observer` interface, and observers directly register themselves with the `Observable` object. This coupling may require additional considerations when modifying or extending the `YouTubeChannel` class.

2. **Design Complexity**: Understanding and implementing the observer pattern may require some initial effort and understanding. It introduces an additional design pattern into our system, which may require developers to familiarize themselves with the concepts and best practices of the pattern.

## Conclusion

By choosing to rely on the observer pattern for tracking the number of subscribers, we can ensure that the count is always accurate, up-to-date, and automatically maintained. Although this decision introduces some level of coupling and design complexity, the benefits in terms of dynamic count management, simplified code, and flexibility outweigh the trade-offs. The observer pattern provides a robust and scalable solution that aligns with our system requirements.
